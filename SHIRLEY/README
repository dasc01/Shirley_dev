This directory contains files used to generate the Shirley interpolation
for electronic wave functions throughout the Brillouin zone.

1. shirley_basis.x

Generates the optimal basis set to span the Brillouin zone derived from
a set of Bloch functions on some grid in k-space.

2. shirley_ham.x

Generates the q-dependent Hamiltonian matrix elements in the optimal basis set
Expands the Hamiltonian in kinetic, local and non-local potential components.
The local potential is constant wrt q, the kinetic energy is quadratic, and
the non-local potential is fit using B-splines over a uniform grid in k-space.
