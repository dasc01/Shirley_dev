&input

prefix : character(255)
         the file prefix for input and output files
         default = 'pwscf'

outdir : character(255)
         the directory for dumping output files like wave functions etc
         default = './'

trace_tol : real(dp)
            when deciding which subspace of the optimal basis set to use
            the eigenvectors of the negative overlap-squared (density matrix) 
            are arranged in increasing order of their eigenvalues.
            Those with the lowest eigenvalues span the space the most, 
            those with the highest eigenvalues (closest in magnitude
            to zero) have a lot of linear dependence.
            trace_tol is used to establish which fraction of the trace -
            the (ordered) sum of the eigenvalues - is to be sacrificed.
            To retain 99.9% of the trace use trace_tol = 0.001
            Negative values mean that no truncation is employed (default)
            default = -1.d0

ndim : integer,dimension(3)
       specifies the dimensionality of the system (or at least the Brillouin
       zone to be interpolated over). Each value must be 0 or 1.
       A value of 1 implies that this dimension is turned on (exists)
       For example a 1D wire with the infinite dimension along the third
       reciprocal lattice vector would require:
         ndim(1)=0, ndim(2)=0, ndim(3)=1
       default = (/ 1, 1, 1 /)

band_subset : integer,dimension(2)
              specifies a subset of the input bands to be used in generating
              the optimal basis set. Values can range from 1 to nbnd.
              A value of 0 in each case results in 1 for the first index
              and nbnd for the second index
              default = (/ 0, 0 /)

expand : logical
         if .true. maps the original input k-points to all k in the 
         non-negative Brillouin zone: [0,1]^3.
         Note that I am including the zone boundary at 1 aswell.
         For example, including translation alone, the Gamma-point will
         be mapped to itself (000) as well as (001), (010), (011), (100), 
         (101), (110), (111).
         In combination with ndim, the number of mappings may be reduced.
         For example with ndim = (/ 0,0,1 /), the Gamma-point is mapped to
         just (000) and (001) in this 1D periodic case.
         This option is developmental.
         It does not include symmetry beyond translational.
         It should be modified in the future to include inversion symmetry
         and rotation.
         default = .true.

debug : logical
        if .true. then generate extra output for debugging
        default = .false.
